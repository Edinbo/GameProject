write down themes, goals ( is it rpg, arpg, fps, mmorpg, turn-based, tcg/ccg)
write down audiences that it might attract (related to those themes)
make a separate draft for each theme
so they're all isolated
write down objectives users might need to achive to gain a certain reward or reach a certain goal or checkpoint
this can be anything
then write down a list of barriers that players must overcome to achieve that said goal
i.e boss battles
pvp
