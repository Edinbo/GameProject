write down themes, goals ( is it rpg, arpg, fps, mmorpg, turn-based, tcg/ccg)
write down audiences that it might attract (related to those themes)
make a separate draft for each theme
so they're all isolated
write down objectives users might need to achive to gain a certain reward or reach a certain goal or checkpoint
this can be anything
then write down a list of barriers that players must overcome to achieve that said goal
i.e boss battles
pvp
leveling up
the amount of money (currency) they need
taht can be anything as well
that*
now what u have is a bunch of puzzle pieces
u can mix and match
and create an idea of a game for
once u have a concept, goal, barrier and objectives
u can piece a story
around that
and tidy it up
